This is a copy of the front end tool i wrote for department of working pensions, the tool was used with OCR (Optical character recognition) this was in the backend. the front end consisted of me writing code that would draw a box on the page using html canvas. the box would then be used to get the positions of its location on the page to be used to gather the users banking information from their bank statements and would digitalise and automate certain internal processes.
